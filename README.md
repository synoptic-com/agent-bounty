# AI Agent Bounty Resources - UPenn Blockchain Hackathon 2025

### Dataset
The dataset for the agent consists of around 28k tweets from a subset of crypto twitter accounts between 2017 and 2025. 
To request access to the dataset please email georgiy@synoptic.com with your team name. Include emails of team members who need access. 
There are no train/eval/test splits. It is your call how to split the data. Due to the nature of the bounty, we recommend using the latest tweets for testing, unlike the usual probabilistic sampling methods.

Note: The dataset is in a MongoDB database. You can use language specific clients to read the files or install [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) and export the data as json/csv.

Note: If you find some twitter profiles that can be useful for you, let us know and we might add them as well, if time allows.

### Compute and API keys
We encourage you to use available models and APIs to build the agent. Please email georgiy@synoptic.com to request OpenAI or Anthropic api keys. 
However, if you want to run some models locally and need GPUs you can request GPU access as well. We have AWS EC2 instances with T4 GPUs. Please briefly explain your idea and what you will use the resources for.
